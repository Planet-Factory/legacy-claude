\section{List of Variables}
Are you ever confused about what something is? Do you ever forget what a variable represents? Then I got the solution for you. The following overview will explain what each variable is and 
represents. I will try to not use one variable for the same thing, though that is sometimes very difficult to do. I'll do my best. In the meantime, enjoy this exstensive list. Note that this 
only applies to variables in code, every symbol in equations are explained at the equations themselves.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $R$: The Gas Constant with value $8.3144621$ (\si{J(mol)^{-1}K}).

    \item $a$: Albedo, the reflectiveness of a substance. Note that $a$ is used in general functions as an array that is supplied as input. If that is the case it can be read at the top of the
